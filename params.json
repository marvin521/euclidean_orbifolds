The embedding is thus guaranteed to be bijective, and also seamless in the sense that modifying the cuts yields the same tiling.\r\n![](https://github.com/noamaig/euclidean_orbifolds/raw/gh-pages/images/david.png)\r\n\r\nIt is also a discrete approximation of a conformal map: \r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/noamaig/euclidean_orbifolds/raw/gh-pages/images/only_ram.png\"  width=\"100\">\r\n\r\nand can be used to generate a map between two surfaces:\r\n![](https://github.com/noamaig/euclidean_orbifolds/raw/gh-pages/images/map.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nand also to create seamless symmetric patterns:\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/noamaig/euclidean_orbifolds/raw/gh-pages/images/crossfields.png\"  width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n",
